      # The text of the text message which can contain URLs which begin with http:// or https:// and formatting.
      # See available formatting options here.
      #
      # If you include URLs in your text and want to include a preview box in text messages (preview_url: true),
      # make sure the URL starts with http:// or https:// â€”https:// URLs are preferred.
      # You must include a hostname, since IP addresses will not be matched.
      # Maximum length: 4096 characters
      #
      # @returns body [String].
      attr_accessor :body

      # Optional.
      # By default, WhatsApp recognizes URLs and makes them clickable, but you can also include a preview box with
      # more information about the link.
      # Set this field to true if you want to include a URL preview box.
      #
      # The majority of the time, the receiver will see a URL they can click on when you send an URL,
      # set preview_url to true, and provide a body object with a http or https link.
      #
      # URL previews are only rendered after one of the following has happened:
      #
      # The business has sent a message template to the user.
      # The user initiates a conversation with a "click to chat" link.
      # The user adds the business phone number to their address book and initiates a conversation.
      #
      # Default: false.
      # @returns preview_url [boolean].
